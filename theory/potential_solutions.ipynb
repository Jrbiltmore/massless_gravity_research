",
    "This notebook explores potential solutions to the modified Poisson equation proposed by Dr. Richard Lieu. The modified Poisson equation incorporates the effects of topological defects, which are hypothesized to influence gravitational fields without requiring detectable mass. We will examine various methods for solving this equation and analyze their implications for astrophysical phenomena.

    "## Modified Poisson Equation
",
    "
",
    "The traditional Poisson equation for gravitational potential \( \Phi \) is given by:
",
    "
",
    "\[\nabla^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho\]
",
    "
",
    "where \( \rho \) is the mass density. Dr. Lieu's modified Poisson equation includes contributions from topological defects:
",
    "
",
    "\[\nabla^2 \Phi = \Lambda\]
",

",
    "where \( \Lambda \) represents the effective density of the topological defects.

    "### Single Shell Solution
",
    "
",
    "Consider a single spherical shell with radius \( r_i \) and surface density \( \sigma_i \). The gravitational potential \( \Phi \) at a distance \( r \) from the center is given by:
",
    "
",
    "\[\Phi(r) = -G \frac{\sigma_i}{|r - r_i|}\]
",
    "
",
    "This potential accounts for the gravitational influence of the shell.
",
    "
",
    "### Multiple Shells
",
    "
",
    "For a system with multiple shells, the total potential \( \Phi_{\text{total}} \) is the sum of the potentials from each shell:
",
    "
",
    "\[\Phi_{\text{total}}(r) = -G \sum_{i} \frac{\sigma_i}{|r - r_i|}\]
",
    "
",
    "This approach allows us to model the gravitational field created by a complex system of topological defects."
