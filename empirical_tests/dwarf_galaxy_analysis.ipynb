    "Dwarf galaxies are small galaxies with lower luminosity, mass, and size compared to larger galaxies like the Milky Way. Studying their dynamics and mass distribution is essential for understanding the role of dark matter and alternative theories like Dr. Richard Lieu's shell-like topological defects. In this notebook, we analyze dwarf galaxies under the influence of these defects.
