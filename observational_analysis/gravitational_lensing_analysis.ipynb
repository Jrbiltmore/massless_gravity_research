    "Gravitational lensing is the bending of light caused by the gravitational field of a massive object. This phenomenon can be used to study the distribution of mass in galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In this notebook, we analyze gravitational lensing effects caused by shell-like topological defects as proposed by Dr. Richard Lieu.
