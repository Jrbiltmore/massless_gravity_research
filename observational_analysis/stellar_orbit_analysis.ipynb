    "Stellar orbits in galaxies provide critical information about the gravitational potential within those galaxies. Traditional models often require dark matter to explain the observed orbital velocities. In this notebook, we analyze the stellar orbits under the influence of shell-like topological defects, as proposed by Dr. Richard Lieu, to see if these structures can account for the observed dynamics.
